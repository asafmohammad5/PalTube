# Background and Overview

Everyone loves pets. In fact some people would rather spend time with them then other people. Here at PalTube we give you just that! A mulititude of videos that show off our furry (or furrless) friends adorable nature. If you love animals, or just want to see something that will brighten your day, head on over to PalTube and start your day with a smile. 

PalTube will use YouTube pet videos as seed data. The content will be dynamic and change based on how the user interacts with the app. Users will be able to create accounts, like/dislike videos, add comments to videos, search for pet videos, and upload pet videos. The pet videos will be organized in categories on the splash page, each video taking you to the video show page. The video show pages will dispaly users comments and likes/dislikes.
